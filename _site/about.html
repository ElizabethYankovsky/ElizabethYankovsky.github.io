Throughout my life I have been repeatedly inspired by the beauty of the natural world. As a child I spent numerous summers in the Appalachian Mountains; I was moved by the timelessness of these areas and the vastness of geologic time that they convey. Growing up in Florida, I was exposed to another side of nature. When I was in middle school, South Florida experienced the most active Atlantic hurricane season on record, with hurricanes Wilma and Katrina both making landfall near my home weeks apart. I remember standing by the ocean prior to Katrina’s landfall and being amazed at the power contained within the waves. In 2015, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Physics and Geophysics, and am presently in my fourth year of a Ph.D. program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. I continue to be fascinated by the complexity and elegance with which the earth functions. The oceans and atmosphere comprise a delicately balanced and intertwined system of processes on scales ranging from millimeters to hundreds of kilometers, seconds to millennia. These processes have deeply shaped human civilization, and continue to do so. I became a scientist to study such processes and to extend a curiosity and admiration for the natural world to people across all backgrounds. </br></br>
I am most interested in theoretical and modeling studies of geophysical fluids, in particular, studying small-scale processes and their effects on large-scale circulation and climate. My current project involves studying the dynamics of dense water formation and transport in the shelf regions of the Arctic Ocean. Dense overflows off the Arctic shelves are key drivers of Arctic circulation, influencing deep water formation and sea-ice processes. Their dynamics is a complex problem governed by local atmospheric forcing and air-sea processes that produce the dense waters; the basin-scale processes determining stratification and guiding the descent of the overflows; and the small-scale mixing that ultimately defines the properties of the descending water. The second direction of this project is to apply insights gained from high-resolution numerical simulations of these processes to improving the shear mixing and mesoscale eddy kinetic energy parameterizations within larger-scale ocean and climate models. My long-term career goal is to pursue research in ocean and climate dynamics as a university professor or research scientist at a government lab. </br></br>
Outside of research, I feel the greatest joys from acquiring new knowledge and abilities, spending time in nature, and being with my family/friends. A few of my current hobbies include yoga, climbing, studying languages, and music. During my first two years of graduate school I volunteered for a local parrot rescue, fostering parrots and helping with fundraising. I care a lot about animals and highly respect the people that stand up for their rights. I enjoy sharing what I learn, and learning from others.  I value the importance of communicating knowledge across disciplines, as we become increasingly specialized and our challenges more urgent. Overall, I believe our species has made numerous environmental, societal, and moral mistakes over the course of our history. Nonetheless, I am inspired by the breakthroughs we each remain capable of; manifesting in the development of science, our understanding of the universe, the creation of art and music, and altruism. It is important for us to remember the chaotic qualities of nature, and strive for breakthroughs on whichever scale we are capable of achieving - they may have effects far beyond what we imagine.
