	    <p>Throughout my life I have been repeatedly inspired by the beauty of the natural world. As a child I spent numerous summers in the Appalachian Mountains; I was moved by the timelessness of these areas and the vastness of geologic time that they convey. Growing up in South Florida, I was exposed to another side of nature. When I was in middle school, South Florida experienced the most active Atlantic hurricane season on record, with hurricanes Wilma and Katrina both making landfall near my home weeks apart. I remember standing by the ocean prior to Katrinaâ€™s landfall and being amazed at the magnitude and power of the waves. I have now embarked on my fourth year of a Ph.D. program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. I continue to be fascinated by the complexity and elegance with which the earth functions. The oceans and atmosphere comprise a delicately balanced and intertwined system of processes on scales ranging from millimeters to hundreds of kilometers, seconds to millennia. These processes have deeply shaped human civilization, and continue to do so. I became a scientist to study such processes and to extend a curiosity and admiration for the natural world to people across all backgrounds.</p>
