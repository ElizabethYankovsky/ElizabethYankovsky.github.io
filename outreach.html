	  <p>Performing an ocean acidification experiment at NJ Ocean Fun Days 2019. Universal pH indicator is added to three cups containing tap water. Lemon juice is added to one (turning the solution red) and a volunteer is asked to blow bubbles (introducing carbon dioxide) into a second cup. As this is done, the water turns yellow, indicating acidification - analogous to the process of carbon uptake by the ocean.</p>

          <h1>New Jersey Ocean Fun Days</h1>
          <h4>NJ Ocean Fun Days are an event held every spring to teach local families and particularly kids about the coastal environment and how to take care of our oceans! 
Each year volunteers come to two locations – Sandy Hook and Island Beach State Park – to present interactive exhibits about local ecosystems, sustainable fisheries, conservation, climate science, and oceanography.
This year I participated in the NOAA-GFDL exhibit at the Island Beach State Park event. We presented experiments on ocean acidification and sea ice to teach visitors about some of the ways in which human activities are influencing the oceans.

	  <h1>Princeton Plasma Physics Lab's Young Women's Conference</h1>
	  <h4>The PPPL Young Women’s Conference is devoted to encouraging middle- and high-school aged girls to pursue careers in STEM fields. Volunteers from local labs and research institutions lead presentations, hands-on-activities, and laboratory tours to introduce students to scientific careers accessible to them. I have been participating in this event for the last two years, and this year I coordinated the Princeton AOS/GFDL exhibit. I and three volunteers designed several experiments to present, and were very happy to see how enthusiastic and knowledgeable the girls we spoke with were. I realized there is no lack of motivation to pursue science/engineering careers among young women, but rather a need for mentoring and helping such students navigate their education and careers.

          <h1>Volunteering in Elizabeth, New Jersey</h1>
          <h4>I volunteered for the nonprofit New Jersey-based organization Future City aimed at educating local communities about environmental issues, working with policy-makers and government agencies, and developing environmental initiatives. I participated in the City of Elizabeth Estuary Day and Environment Day where I performed lab experiments and discussed climate dynamics with groups of students from local schools. Additionally, I worked with summer interns at Future City during the summer of 2017 and had an interview with the city’s mayor to discuss environmental issues.

The title of the program was “Motion in the Ocean: Our Oceans and You”. I presented hands-on experiments and spoke with students regarding their thoughts on climate science and a simplified summary of my research on Arctic dynamics.</h4>

          <h4>The Future City organization that I volunteered with collaborates with the NY/NJ Harbor Estuary Program to protect the habitat of one of the most populated estuaries and metropolitan areas in the world. I attended Trash Free Waters Meeting of the Environmental Protection Agency in New York City to lead discussions regarding pollution issues facing the NY/NJ Harbor Estuary and actions we can take to address these problems.
