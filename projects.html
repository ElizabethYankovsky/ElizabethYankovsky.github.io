	  Dating back to Fridtjof Nansen's observational work in the early 20th century, it has been known that the marginal shelf seas of the Arctic Ocean experience intense dense water formation during the fall and winter months. The combination of brine rejection from developing sea-ice and heat loss at the surface leads to convection spanning the entire depth and creation of highly dense waters in the shallow shelf seas. In particular, the Kara and Barents Seas exhibit strong polynya activity (formation of gaps in sea-ice that allow heat loss to the atmosphere to persist) and contain warm, salty Atlantic inflow water. As a result, the densest waters in the Arctic (and even World Ocean) are formed on on their shelves during the sea-ice formation period. In this study, we analyze existing global ocean model simulations to see whether dense water formation and export processes are presently captured in large-scale GCMs.
 We are also currently developing regional simulations of the Kara Sea at resolutions that are able to capture mesoscale eddies and some submesoscale features. The purpose of this is to gain a better understanding of how dense water is guided from the shelves into the abyssal Arctic and to test mixing parameterization implementations.

We revisit the problem of rotating, stratified gravity current dynamics by performing numerical simulations of dense water formation on a shelf and transport down a slope using the nonhydrostatic MITgcm. Grid resolutions are 5-20m in the vertical and 25-100m in the horizontal, allowing a wide spectrum of submesoscale variability to be captured. We examine 2- and 3-dimensional cases and find the submesoscale range of both to be dominated by symmetric instability (SI). SI leads to the onset of secondary shear instability, dissipation of geostrophic energy, and water mass modification. Rotating dense overflows are characterized by an initial geostrophic adjustment phase, which creates a bottom-intensified (and compensating surface-intensified) jet. In 2D, Ekman drainage leads to downslope descent of the geostrophic jet, forming a highly dense alongslope front. Beams of negative Ertel potential vorticity develop parallel to the slope, initiating SI and vigorous mixing in the overflow. In 3D, baroclinic eddies are responsible for cross-isobath dense water transport but SI again develops along the slope and at eddy edges. Through two different dynamics the 2D SI-dominated case and 3D eddy-dominated case attain roughly the same final water mass distribution, highlighting the potential role of SI in driving mixing within certain regimes of dense overflows. In the second part of this study we perform analogous simulations using the GFDL-MOM6 hydrostatic model, employing both z* and layered isopycnal vertical coordinate systems. We explore the impact of vertical coordinate, horizontal resolution, and parameterizations of shear-driven mixing and mesoscale eddies on the representation of the water mass transformation processes observed in the high-resolution cases.

          <h1>Undergraduate Research</h1><h4>Here are summarized three undergraduate research projects that inspired my interest in geophysical fluid dynamics and oceanography. The first was conducted within the Geophysical Exploration Laboratory at the University of South Carolina, examining cellular convection processes within the subsurface sediments of the Aleutian Basin. The second and third were summer NSF-REU projects at Rutgers University and Oregon State University, focused on turbulent mixing dynamics in estuaries.</h4>

During my sophomore year as an undergraduate, I began research at the Geophysics Exploration Laboratory at my university and was awarded the Magellan Scholarship research grant. I continued this work for three years – culminating in an AGU Fall Meeting presentation, senior thesis, and a <a href="https://www.vibgyorpublishers.org/content/international-journal-of-earth-science-and-geophysics/ijesg-1-001.pdf">publication</a> in the International Journal of Earth Science and Geophysics (2015). The goal of the project was to apply the mathematics of Rayleigh-Benard convection in a porous medium to subsurface methane-hydrate systems and combine this with an analysis of seismic and gravity data from the central Aleutian Basin. The first component of the project involved modeling methane plumes, generating synthetic seismic data from these models, and comparing it to field data – the models successfully reproduced features evident in field data. In the second part of the project, I developed an algorithm for extracting a gravity signal from ship-borne gravimeter data to determine if there is a correlation between methane plumes and gravity anomalies. Remarkably, we found consistent lows in gravitational acceleration values (suggesting mass deficit) at the supposed plume locations – supporting our hypothesis of significant methane-hydrate presence in the central Aleutian Basin.

After initially becoming interested in fluid dynamics through the above project, I participated in an NSF-REU program at Rutgers University during the summer of 2013. I worked with Dr. Robert Chant on a project aimed at quantifying turbulent dissipation in the Raritan River estuary (NJ) using several conventional and novel techniques. The conventional methods utilized velocity data collected from a velocimeter from which turbulent dissipation was estimated using a spectral method as well as using a boundary layer model. The drawback to the spectral method was that velocity was only measured at one point so turbulence was assumed to be “frozen” through the entire water column while the boundary layer model had to assume overly simplified dynamics inconsistent with a stratified estuary. The novel technique relied on data from an acoustic Doppler current profiler, which was processed using the structure function method, yielding a vertical profile of turbulent dissipation. Aside from improving our understanding of the dynamics of the Raritan River estuary, this project demonstrated the potential use of the structure function method to measure turbulence from a moving platform such as a glider, drifter, or towed vehicle. The project introduced me to field work, the rigors of data processing, as well as theory of turbulence.

During the summer of 2014, I participated in a second NSF-REU program at Oregon State University’s College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences. I worked with Dr. James Lerczak on measuring the response of the length and stratification of the North River estuary (MA) to variations in river discharge and tidal amplitude. We determined estuary length by approximating a linear along-channel salinity gradient and found that it has a weak negative dependence on discharge and a positive relationship to tidal amplitude. Stratification exhibits an increase with increasing discharge and a decrease with increasing tidal amplitude. The response time between a change in river discharge and change in estuary length was found to be about 21-23 hours. Our findings allowed us to classify the regime of the North River as generally well-mixed, but with stratification becoming more persistent as river discharge increases. The project contributed to my understanding of data and time-series processing, applied mathematics, and estuarine dynamics. I presented the results at the AGU 2014 Fall Meeting.
